## First time at an Hackathon? What to do...
- Pick a topic to work on. Choose by
  - Experience : You know something or worked on that or a similar topic?
  - Interest : You're interested in the problem and like to dive in?
  - Participate : Diversity rulez! Especially outsiders can have an impact by bringing in unconventional ideas and aspects.
- You want to know more about a specific topic?
  - Pick a technology and walk yourself through one of the tutorials.
  - Think of a very simple problem you can solve in the given time.
  - Ask for help if you're stuck.
- Get Creative!
  - The best ideas come with not so obvious problems.
  - Think of your daily live. What bothers you? What would help?
  - Talk to people about your ideas and discuss solutions.
- Always hydrate!
    

## Challenges

### Quality assurance of sensor data
In future, the city's [Urban Data Platform](https://opendata.jena.de/) (UDP) will make real-time data from many hundreds of sensors available, e.g. for environmental and weather data, soil moisture, traffic, energy consumption. These will only be operated in part by the city of Jena itself; other institutions, companies and private individuals will also provide data. To ensure the quality of these data, criteria for evaluating the quality of sensor time series data are to be developed and, if possible, implemented on the software side.

### Assembly of Open Bike Sensors
With a traffic share of 15 %, the bicycle is omnipresent in the cityscape of Jena as a sustainable means of transport. The "Jena 2035+ Cycling Plan" aims to further expand the existing infrastructure and create a safe and attractive cycling network in the urban area. By using the [Open Bike Sensors](https://www.openbikesensor.org/), danger spots for cyclists in urban traffic are to be localised with the help of the integrated overtaking distance meter, so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken in the future. As part of the Challenge, these Open Bike Sensors will be built and prepared so that their data can be imported into a data portal for evaluation and visualisation.

### Data visualisation of real-time data
In addition to sensor data, event-related data will also be stored on the Urban Data Platform in the future. This includes, for example, the switching states of traffic participants and the associated control processes. The aim of this challenge is to visualise tram and bus movements, including route and delay indicators, vehicle capacity utilisation or the boarding and alighting of people, either on maps or on map-independent charts, depending on the use case.

### Pedestrian frequency
By means of a pedestrian frequency measurement, it is recorded how many people pass a certain counting point within a certain period of time. The pedestrian frequency is an important parameter, especially for retailers/the real estate industry, but also for the city administration and economic development, in order to be able to assess the attractiveness of walking locations, for example. The goal is now to develop a data protection-compliant solution for recording pedestrian flows at various locations in the city.

### Soil Moisture Sensoring
Under current and future climatic conditions, vegetation is increasingly suffering from stress, especially in urban areas. Optimal and also resource-saving supplementary irrigation is thus becoming the focus for the preservation and maintenance of urban vegetation.
With the help of sensors that measure the moisture content in the soil, data on the actual water supply of the vegetation can be obtained and targeted irrigation can be planned. Currently, sensors are being used for test purposes at sites for planting new urban trees and for a monitoring project in the urban forest. A city-wide sensor network is currently being set up. This data is to be evaluated and visualised as part of the Challenge. The aim is to use the data to develop an urban watering route optimisation in order to be able to optimally supply the urban greenery in future dry periods.

## Tutorials ##

Pick one of the tutorials fitting your interest and expertise. Most of the technology used here is available in the Lichtwerkstatt. Ask or message Johannes, Canan or David for more information or help. 

### **BASIC** TinkerCAD
TinkerCAD is a free web-based application to design 3d models or electronic circuits. You can easily learn to build your own 3d printable objects or basic microcontrolled circuits in an afternoon without any pre-knowledge. TinkerCAD runs on a pc, laptop or tablet and all you need is an account.

### **BASIC** Arduino
Arduino is a easy programmable Microcontroller. The language used is very basic and helps you programming on the go. All you need to do is take an Arduino, install the Arduino IDE on your computer and then get some LEDs blinking.
