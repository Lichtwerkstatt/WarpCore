## Materials
* black, white and red cardboard
* colored origami paper (20x20cm), shiny origami paper (10x10cm)
* tracing paper
* 4mm ply wood
* LED tea light candle (âŒ€38mm), CR2032 battery
* paper glue, glue and glue gun

## Vectorgraphics
* use a Vectorgraphic Program of your Choice
  * [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/illustrator.html) (contained in Adobe Cloud licence for FSU staff and students)
  * [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (Open Source)
  * [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/) (nice and cheap for Desktop and iPad)

## Beginner Tips&Tricks
* use primitive shapes and combine them with boolean operations
* use grid and automatic snap when designing interlocking parts
* use bitmaps(photos) to trace vector paths on top
* search for suitable graphics on the internet and trace them
* high-res black/white images are tracable automatically in Illustrator

## Lasercutter
* design your model in small parts and export in individual SVGs to facilitate using left-over material
* imports an SVG File
  * path contour or fill colors dont matter
  * path thickness doesnt matter
* dont forget to convert objects (especially text) into paths
* Lasercutter will cut EVERY path, so look out for
  * paths with no contour color
  * paths with no visible color (white)
  * paths with zero thickness
* wood has thickness of 4mm, plan intersecting pieces accordingly.
* cut your model in cardboard first if you're unsure
