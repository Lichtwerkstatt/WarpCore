# Visulization for Scientists

## 0. Prep

Tools:

- Pencil (Sharpener, Rubber)
- Fineliner (non-erasable)
- optional:
  - any pens
  - iPads, Tablet

**Room:**

- PinwÃ¤nde

## 1. Warmup

- Safe place
- No Shaming!
- Pin everything!

### Task

- Fold A4 in half
- draw yourself or your neighbour
- draw an elephant riding a bicycle

## Theory 1

- Graphic Sketchnotes/Facilitation/Recording
- WHY - WHAT - HOW
- TEXT - Data Viz - Science Viz
- CON
  - abstraction
  - space limitation
  - distraction
  - time consuming
  - skill requirement
- PRO
  - structure: (self, team, audience)
  - enhanced memory retention (recalling information)
  - improved comprehension (simplification of complex)
  - engagement, attention, focus mind
  - unversial language (barriers), low threshold, inclusive
  - productive (brainstorming, idea generation, quick effective)
  - organization, structure information
  - creative expression, doodles, typography, enjoyable process
  - artistic process: reflection, emotions
  - entertaining
  - out of the box thinking, cognitive processing
- MindMap, Mnemonic Device
- Sketchnotes / Facilitation
  - Text / Emphasis
  - Shapes
  - Containers, Connectors
  - Shapes, Icons, Illustrations, Shading, Colors

## 2. Begriff Abstraktion

Example HOUSE

- icon
- metaphor : snail, nest, fortress, blanket fortress
- personification face, moving home, settled home (reading, knitting)
- usecase , same with person
- typtography
- juxtaposition : tall houses, house in weather

Words:

- Gravity
- Photosynthesis
- Evolution
- Relativity
- Cell Theory
- Quantum Mechanics
- Atomic Theory
- Big Bang Theory
- Radioactivity
- Cryptography
- Thermodynamics
- Black Hole
- Virus
- Molecule
- Vaccine
- Artificial Intelligence

### Task

Draw your concept in 5 different ways

- each one selfcontaining illustration, no Rebus Puzzles
- do NOT use any words, boxes, arrows
- find metaphers, allegories

## Theory 2

- Style
  - Scott McCloud REALITY - MEANING - PICTURE (ABSTRACTION)
- Pre-Knowledge vs Art
- easy vs. loss of information
- choices:

  - cultural background (artist vs. audience)
  - training
  - time / ressources
  - tools available
  - audience want/expect

  Example Smily on TShirt

## 3. Shapes!

- (Line), Square, Triangle, Circles
- why?
  - fight the fear of the white canvas / confidence
  - composition / layout / proportion
  - concept development, experiment
- important
  - communicate the thing (silouette)
  - be an engineer! (from inside to outside)
  - communicate functionality

### Task

Draw a device/object you use every day.
Change proportions of some shapes and see what happens

- Electron-Microscope
- PEEM

## 4. Combine Shapes

- Where is my line?
- Overlap
- Partial Overlap
- Union
- Smooth
- distant smooth
- effects folds

- art style: thickness, wiggles = texture and space

## 5. Line of Action

- Dynamics, Movement
- Line of Action -> Silhouette
- Keep Volume
- Build Anticipation

### Tasks

Let the device do sports:

- running
- jumping
- soccer
- javelin
-

## 6 Faces and Emotions

- move shapes

## 7. Third Dimension

- Shapes!
- Perspective: isometric, vanishing point
- Arrange Elements
- Cross Sections
- Center Lines - Line of Action
- Project Text / Images
- Wiggle perspective is fine.

## 8 Gradient

- Where is the light?
  - Shadow lines
- Dark shadows first
- Gradient Shadows
- Reflected Light

## 9 Let's go realistic

- Example : Cube, Zylinder
- no lines, only gradients
- values
- positive negative space
