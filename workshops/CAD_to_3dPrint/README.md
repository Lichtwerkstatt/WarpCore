- Who knows CAD/3D Models /3D Printing?

## CAD
- Basic Workflow: IDEA -> 3D Model -> 3D Print
- History of technical Drawings:
  - Find Mistakes / Inconsistencies / Lack of Information
  - Smaller to Bigger Projects (matching parts)
  - Changes/Mistakes -> whole process of redrawing, communication, revision very expensive
- CAD as a solution: supervision/help
  - formal and clear unambigious model
  - model decisions (constraints), paramaters
  - limited set of operations
  - non-destructive Process(!), Computer calculates implications
- extended CAD today
  - CAD/CAM -> CAE
  - simulation
  - applications -> program interfaces, data im- and export
 
### CAD Programs
- Licences : FSU Autodesk Inventor, SolidWorks, PTC?
- Educational: [FUSION 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) (Maker), [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/de/) (browserbased)
