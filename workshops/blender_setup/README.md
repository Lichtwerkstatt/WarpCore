- Blender is a lot
  - might not understand everything
  - workflow oriented
  - first straight forward / after that open questions/problems
- Communicate!
- BIG Workshop Spring 2024

## Workflow

### Getting Models
- CAD : Thorlabs / GrabCAD
  -> Problem no Mesh!
- STL : basic Mesh, 3d Printing
  -> Problem no good ressources (why print a component)
- OBJ : Mesh with Materials/Colors
  - same as STL BUT Conversion from CAD possible
  - use CAD software for import/export
  - problem a lot of geometry! -> optimization necessary
- BLENDER
  - OpticCore
  - Components Package

### Components Package Introduction
- do NOT participate
- NON PROCEDURAL
  - basic Meshs with Materials

  - based on geometry nodes
  - spline based
